# Open Source Polarimeter 

**TL;DR** Open Source Arduino controlled polarimeter used to measure the angle of polarized light rotation.


## Background
In 1913 German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten were investigating enzyme kinetics.  Using sucrose, an enzyme called invertase, and a polarimeter they were able to design a model depicting the rate of an enzyme (E), to a substrate (S) to create a product (P ).  The enzyme was invertase, the substrate was sucrose, and the product was glucose and fructose.

A polarimeter was used to graph the change in solution over time.  First, light from a sodium Lamp 589 nm, is passed through the first polarizing filter.  That linear light then passes into the sample cell of known length (xxx cm).  The interaction between the sample and polarized light rotates the polarized light.  The second polarizing filter is used to calculate the angle caused by the sample.  This returns the optical rotation angle.

As the Enzymed and Substrated produced more product the optical rotation changed.
